# Field failure (PMGO-004): in a sandbox that denies `ps`, a timed-out run killed
# its direct child and the DESCENDANT survived. The 0.16 kill built its target
# list solely from `ps -A -o pid= -o ppid=`, ignored that command's return code,
# and wrapped the whole interpreter in `2>/dev/null || true` — so a denied
# enumeration was indistinguishable from a childless process, and the failure was
# invisible. Cleanup reported success while a provider kept writing to a
# worktree.
#
# Every case here therefore denies `ps`. The two that matter most also deny
# os.getpgid on other pids (c1b), which is the shape of the restricted sandbox
# from the field report: there the caller's own `session` claim is the only
# remaining containment proof.
#
# NOTE: bash announces the death of the background jobs these cases kill
# ("Killed: 9" / "Terminated:" lines on stderr). That is this shell's job reaper
# reporting a job it started, not a test failure — a real session leader has to
# be a background job of this shell for the un-reaped-pid guarantee to hold.
