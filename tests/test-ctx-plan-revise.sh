# Covers the plan-revision-loop bound authority library brick
# engine/ctx-plan-revise.sh:
#   gluerun_plan_revise_decide <verdict> <revisions_done> — pure, deterministic
#     decider mapping a plan-critic verdict + rounds-already-spent to the next
#     loop action, bounded by GLUERUN_PLAN_REVISE_MAX (default 1). Prints EXACTLY
#     one line, NEVER exits non-zero, and NEVER resolves ambiguity to `revise`
#     (so no unbounded revision path can exist).
#   gluerun_plan_revise_max — pure helper centralizing the default-1 bound.
#
# Contract asserted here (acceptance criteria for TASK-0019):
#   approve                       -> import
#   revise, done < effectiveMax   -> revise <done+1>
#   revise, done >= effectiveMax  -> park revise-budget-exhausted
#   park (explicit terminal)      -> park park
#   empty / unknown verdict       -> park <reason> (fail-closed)
#   non-int/negative revisions    -> park <reason> (fail-closed)
#   non-int/negative MAX          -> park <reason> (fail-closed)
# The effective max reads GLUERUN_PLAN_REVISE_MAX, defaulting to 1 when unset or
# empty; an override is honored.
#
# The engine file defines NEW functions only and is invoked by no existing engine
# path; this test runs against isolated state (no real run state mutated).
