# Covers the plan-critic CONTEXT assembler brick engine/ctx-plan-critic-context.sh:
# the read-only staged-candidate critic context the S2 skeptic (plan-critic-driver)
# must actually receive. This file defines NEW functions only and is invoked by NO
# existing engine path, so with it present-but-uncalled the engine is byte-identical
# to prior behavior (mirroring engine/ctx-plan-critic.sh and engine/ctx-paired-audit.sh).
#
# Asserts:
#   (a) resolver -> gluerun_ctx_plan_critic_stage_file <node> prints the node's
#       docs/context-build-plan/ stage file for a node present in that plan and
#       empty for an unknown node; resolution is read-only.
#   (b) assembler -> gluerun_ctx_plan_critic_context <node> <stage_dir> <out_file>
#       writes a single composed context file whose content includes every
#       candidate task body, the existing-task summary, and the node's stage-file
#       content.
#   (c) purity -> the assembler writes ONLY the named output file, appends NO
#       events, and leaves the stage-dir inputs unchanged.
#   (d) determinism -> candidate bodies compose in a stable (sorted) order so the
#       composed context is byte-stable across runs (idempotence).
#   (e) present-but-uncalled -> no existing engine path invokes the new functions.
# The events log is pinned to an isolated GLUERUN_EVENTS_FILE and temp dirs so the
# suite never mutates real run state.
