# 0.17.0 (PMGO-001): the DAG lens's placement maths lives in a pure, import-free
# module (plugin/assets/plan/dag_layout.js) so dependency-wave layout can be
# asserted without a browser. This wrapper hands tests/console/dag_layout.test.mjs
# to node's built-in runner and guards the one invariant that would silently
# break the arrangement: an import in the module under test would drag the whole
# console app (app.js, the DOM) into a bare node run and the suite could never
# load it again. Without node the suite skips — the engine must stay testable on
# a box with no JS toolchain.
