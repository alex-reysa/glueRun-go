# Covers the SECOND slice of the OPTIONAL authored-knowledge manifest ingestion
# leaf (stage S5-routing, node `rehydrate-path`, layer engine_runtime).
# `engine/ctx-rehydrate-authored-eligible.sh` ships a PURE, read-only,
# present-but-uncalled eligibility filter
#
#   gluerun_ctx_rehydrate_authored_eligible <trigger> [<trigger> ...]
#
# that reads the selector's JSON-Lines (one authored-knowledge record per line,
# each carrying id / source / class=authored-knowledge / authoritative=false /
# load-when / freshness) on stdin and emits only the entries eligible to inject
# for the current trigger context:
#
#   - load-when: an entry is eligible iff its load-when list is empty (the
#     documented unconditional baseline) or contains at least one supplied
#     trigger; ineligible entries are dropped.
#   - freshness gate: an entry whose freshness is a documented stale/expired
#     state is NEVER emitted as current (mirroring TASK-0058's
#     description_unverified rule), so non-current authored knowledge can never
#     be presented as current or authoritative.
#   - class markers pass through unchanged: emitted entries keep
#     class=authored-knowledge and authoritative=false; the filter never
#     elevates an entry to authoritative.
#   - deterministic, id-sorted output; identical input+triggers -> byte-identical.
#   - pure / read-only / fail-soft: malformed JSONL lines are skipped, empty
#     stdin yields empty output, it mutates nothing on disk, and never exits
#     non-zero on well-formed input.
