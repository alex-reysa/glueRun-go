# Covers TASK-0106 — closing the injection/recording gap of the executable DAG
# node `subgraph-rehydrate` (stage S6-graph, layer engine_runtime). TASK-0105
# made the ROUTE DECIDE `rehydrate` over the subgraph manifest on the treatment
# arm, but the packet the model receives (engine/l1-drive.sh
# rehydrate_inject_packet) and the manifest the strategy event records
# (engine/ctx-rehydrate-event.sh singular_ctx_rehydrate_event_data) were still
# FLAT. This slice adds a shared selector and wires it into BOTH sites so the
# injected packet and the recorded manifest carry the SAME subgraph sources by
# construction.
#
#   singular_ctx_route_subgraph_render <task_id> <packet|manifest>
#     - When singular_ctx_rehydrate_subgraph_arm_mode <task_id> <graphDir> ==
#       subgraph (graphDir = ${SINGULAR_CTX_GRAPH_DIR:-.singular-state/graph}),
#       resolve node = singular_graph_node_id(singular_graph_identity task <task_id>)
#       and print singular_ctx_rehydrate_subgraph_assemble <graphDir> <node> <mode>,
#       returning 0.
#     - Otherwise print nothing and return non-zero (caller keeps its FLAT path).
#
# Asserts:
#   (A) selector: exists; OFF (knob unset/0) -> non-zero + empty for both modes;
#       ON + treatment arm + present non-empty corpus -> byte-identical to the
#       subgraph assembler at the DETERMINISTIC task node id, for both modes;
#       control arm / absent-empty corpus -> non-zero + empty. Both call sites
#       therefore resolve the SAME node by construction.
#   (B) inject hook (engine/l1-drive.sh rehydrate_inject_packet): on the subgraph
#       branch the fresh rehydrate attempt's $active_prompt receives the SUBGRAPH
#       packet under the reference-only / NOT-authoritative provenance header, NOT
#       the flat packet; on every off path it stays byte-identical to the flat
#       injection.
#   (C) record hook (engine/ctx-rehydrate-event.sh singular_ctx_rehydrate_event_data):
#       on the subgraph branch the recorded strategy-event manifest is the SUBGRAPH
#       manifest; on every off path it stays the flat manifest.
#   (D) SINGULAR_REHYDRATE gate: rehydrate_inject_packet is a no-op unless
#       worker_strategy==rehydrate (only reachable behind SINGULAR_REHYDRATE=1).
#   (E) evidence invariance: rehydrate stays tainted; the injected subgraph section
#       stays reference-only / NOT authoritative.
