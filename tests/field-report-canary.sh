# 11: a 503/529 was classified `overloaded` and then bucketed as `quota`, so a
#     capacity blip selected the 1800s usage-limit window -- and because that nap
#     `continue`s past reconcile, it idled the whole graph for half an hour.
# 12: gate-check.sh cited an absolute logRef, which dag.sh's safe_repo_artifact
#     rejects before any other check, so no report the engine produced could ever
#     back a deterministic-proof gate-result.
# 13: dag.sh's precise diagnostic went to /dev/null at every call site, so an
#     invalid DAG was indistinguishable from having no ready work.
