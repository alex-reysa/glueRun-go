# PMGO-009: `gluerun test` is the supervised, attachable form of the engine's
# own regression suite. What that has to be true of:
#
#   a  --no-wait starts a detached run and returns: manifest published, current
#      run repointed, and the supervisor's flock HELD (the liveness proof)
#   b  plain `gluerun test` while one is live ATTACHES to it — no second run —
#      and exits with the suite's own exit code once it finishes
#   c  --status --json parses, and reports liveness after completion
#   d  --rerun-failures starts a new run filtered to the last completed run's
#      failures, and runs only those
#   e  --new-run overrides the single-instance attach and repoints current
#   f  a supervisor killed mid-run reconciles to "interrupted" on the next read
#      (the lock dies with the process; nothing polls a pid to find out)
#   g  an engine that ships no tests/ fails once, by name
#   g2 an engine home that is not a Git CHECKOUT refuses BEFORE anything is
#      created — no run dir, no manifest, no current.json, no supervisor — while
#      --status/--wait still report on a past run there
#   h  tests/run.sh's own hooks: run dir set -> per-test logs + progress.jsonl
#      and a working basename filter; run dir unset -> byte-identical output and
#      nothing written
#   i  --wait with nothing ever recorded is an error, not a hang
#
# Everything runs against FIXTURE suites (three dummy tests), never the real
# ~50-minute one.
