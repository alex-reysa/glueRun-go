#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Covers the continue/resume classifier leaf brick engine/ctx-route-strategy.sh:
#   gluerun_ctx_route_strategy_classify <role> <step>
#
# The stage-distinct split of a would-be `resume` verdict into two strategies:
#   continue = "same session, same lineage, next phase" — the actor re-engaging
#              its OWN lineage (planner revising its node's plan; implementer /
#              worker retry-resuming its own task).
#   resume   = "a persisted specialist re-engaged over accepted work" — critic
#              recheck, reviewer re-audit, and any skeptic/advocate re-invoked as
#              an auditor.
#
# It is a PURE predicate: prints EXACTLY one token from {continue, resume} on one
# line, appends no events, writes no files, and never exits non-zero.
#
# Contract asserted here (each strategy enumerated with its role/step reason):
#   - Primary-lineage continuation -> continue:
#       planner revising its node's plan; implementer/worker retry-resuming.
#   - Specialist re-engagement -> resume:
#       critic recheck, reviewer re-audit, skeptic/advocate re-invoked as auditor.
#   - Fail closed: unrecognized or empty role/step -> resume, NEVER continue.
#       (A primary-lineage role with a non-continuation step is still resume; a
#        specialist role is resume regardless of step.)
#   - Taint consistency (behavioral pin, planner-contract rule 9): feeding the
#       classifier's output into gluerun_ctx_route_strategy_tainted yields 0 for
#       every `continue` and 1 for every `resume`.
# The predicate is defined only; NO existing engine path invokes it, so with the
# file present-but-uncalled the engine is byte-identical to prior behavior.
