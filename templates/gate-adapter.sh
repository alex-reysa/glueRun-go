# gluerun gate adapter — scaffold. Copy to docs/orchestration/gates/gate.sh,
# point gateCommand at it, and replace the RUN block with your real gate.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The gate's exit code answers one question: did the command succeed? The engine
# needs two more that an exit code cannot express.
#
#   1. WHICH failures happened, as stable signatures. That is what lets a repo
#      register a baseline of known-failing tests (`gluerun gate baseline`) and
#      have the engine tell an acknowledged failure apart from a new one. With
#      no signatures the engine can only see "non-zero" and must treat every
#      run against a baseline as unclassifiable.
#
#   2. Whether the gate COULD RUN AT ALL. A missing dependency, a full disk or
#      an unreachable network is not a defect in the code under test, and the
#      engine must not spend a task's retry budget asking a model to fix code
#      that was never broken. Setting infrastructureFailure says so directly,
#      instead of leaving the engine to guess from log text.
#
# Neither is required. A gate that just exits 0 or 1 works: the engine reads the
# exit code, applies a deliberately conservative set of log signatures for the
# unmistakable environment failures, and otherwise calls a non-zero exit a
# product failure. This file is how you do better than that guess.
#
# CONTRACT
#
# The engine sets GLUERUN_GATE_REPORT_FILE to a path. Write a
# gluerun.orchestration.gate-observation.v0 document there, or don't — an absent
# file is a valid outcome and means "no structured information". It is never
# required just because the repo is on schemaVersion v2.
#

#     "schema": "gluerun.orchestration.gate-observation.v0",
#     "failures": [ {"signature": "suite/case-name", "title": "human summary"} ],
#     "infrastructureFailure": false,
#     "infrastructureReason": ""
#   }
#
# Signatures must be STABLE across runs — a file and test name, not a line
# number, a duration or a temp path — because a baseline matches on them.
# Report failures even when the command exits 0 if you know about them.
