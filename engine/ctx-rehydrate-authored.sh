# ctx-rehydrate-authored.sh — pure, read-only authored-knowledge manifest
# selector (stage S5-routing, node `rehydrate-path`, layer engine_runtime;
# singular-brain integration point 3). Sourced exactly once by the
# context-evolution loader block in lib.sh (it matches the ctx-*.sh glob). This
# file DEFINES new functions only and is present-but-uncalled by every existing
# engine/CLI/driver path, so with it sourced the engine stays byte-identical to
# prior behavior.
#
# This is the FIRST slice of the explicitly-OPTIONAL authored-knowledge
# deliverable. It parses a FIXTURE authored-knowledge manifest JSON and selects
# the injectable entries; it does NOT yet wire into singular.config.json or the
# packet assembler (those are later slices). SINGULAR_CTX_MANIFEST (default 0)
# gates that future wire-in, NOT this pure leaf. The JSON contract is the whole
# interface: it takes NO dependency on any singular-brain runtime.
#
#   singular_ctx_rehydrate_authored_select <manifest-json-path>
#
# Reads a machine-readable authored-knowledge manifest of the form
#   { "entries": [ { "id", <"body"|"path">, "load-when":[...], "freshness",
#                    "description_unverified"? }, ... ] }
# and prints, one JSON object per line, the SELECTED injectable entries under the
# AUTHORED-KNOWLEDGE class rules:
#
#   - Each surviving entry is emitted with its id and tagged
#     "class":"authored-knowledge" — human-curated content, DISTINCT from durable
#     host-verified artifacts AND from model-authored (tainted) records. It is
#     NEVER marked authoritative: every emitted object carries
#     "authoritative": false and no host-verified / tainted marker.
#   - An entry flagged `description_unverified` is NEVER emitted as current: it is
#     skipped, so it can never be treated as current or authoritative.
#   - A path-backed entry is filtered through the integrated
#     singular_ctx_artifact_exclude, so a quarantined path (a `*.quarantined` path,
#     or an original whose `.quarantined` sibling exists on disk) never survives.
#     A single quarantine authority is thereby preserved.
#   - Output is deterministic: entries are emitted in a fixed id-sorted order, so
#     identical manifest bytes yield byte-identical output.
#
# The emission form is suitable for a LATER slice to ingest into the rehydration
# packet and to record the injected entry ids in the packet manifest like any
# other source.
#
# Pure and READ-ONLY: it reads the manifest (and, for the quarantine check, tests
# for `.quarantined` siblings) but never writes, renames, or deletes anything;
# appends no events; and never exits non-zero on well-formed input. A malformed
# or absent manifest yields an empty selection (fail-soft).
