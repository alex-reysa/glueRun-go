# Per-run assumption ledger seed (stage S4-context-packets, node assumption-ledger).
# Sourced exactly once by the context-evolution loader block in lib.sh (it matches
# the ctx-*.sh glob). Like engine/ctx-packet.sh, this file defines a PURE helper and
# is present-but-uncalled by every existing engine/CLI/driver path, so with it
# sourced the engine stays byte-identical to prior behavior (notably under
# GLUERUN_CTX_PACKET=0, which no path here consults).
#
# This is the foundational data-structure slice the later wire-in slices (fix/audit
# prompt injection behind GLUERUN_CTX_PACKET, per-attempt carry, host-derived status
# transitions) build on. It seeds a per-run assumption ledger from a task's context
# packet by composing the already-integrated gluerun_ctx_packet_json parser. Each
# seeded assumption gets a stable, deterministic id (A1, A2, … over the packet's
# declared order) so a later host-derived transition — an auditor finding that
# references an assumption's id — has a fixed anchor.

# gluerun_ctx_assumptions_seed <task-file>
#
# Reads <task-file> STRICTLY READ-ONLY (composing gluerun_ctx_packet_json) and
# prints a normalized per-run assumption ledger JSON on stdout:
#   {"schema":"gluerun.orchestration.ctx-assumptions.v0",
#    "assumptions":[{"id":"A1","status":..,"claim":..,"basis":..}, ...]}
#
#   - packet declaring assumptions -> one ledger entry per assumption, in the
#     packet's declared order, each carrying a stable positional id (A1, A2, …) and
#     preserving that assumption's status (open|validated|violated), claim, basis.
#   - no `## Context packet` block, an empty packet ({}), or zero assumptions ->
#     stable empty ledger {"schema":...,"assumptions":[]}.
#   - a malformed packet fails closed THROUGH the underlying parser (which prints {}
#     and appends its single ctx.packet_malformed warning) -> empty ledger; the seed
#     re-emits nothing and has no side effects of its own.
