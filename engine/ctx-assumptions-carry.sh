# Per-attempt carry brick of the per-run assumption ledger (stage S4-context-packets,
# node assumption-ledger). Sourced exactly once by the context-evolution loader block in
# lib.sh (it matches the ctx-*.sh glob). Like engine/ctx-assumptions.sh and its siblings,
# this file defines a PURE helper and is present-but-uncalled by every existing
# engine/CLI/driver path, so with it sourced the engine stays byte-identical to prior
# behavior (notably under GLUERUN_CTX_PACKET=0, which no path here consults).
#
# The seed (engine/ctx-assumptions.sh) emits a fresh per-run ledger for each attempt from
# the task packet (the per-run source of truth, unchanged between attempts). This slice
# ships the per-attempt carry: it merges the PRIOR attempt's ledger into the CURRENT
# attempt's fresh seed so a host-observed `violated` status carries forward across retries
# — like an open finding that persists until addressed — while the current seed stays the
# STRUCTURAL AUTHORITY for which assumptions exist and what they claim.
#
# This is later composed by the wire-in slices (composed per-run assembler, capsule
# recording, fix/audit prompt injection behind GLUERUN_CTX_PACKET). This slice does NOT
# touch driver files, compose the assembler, record the capsule, inject into any prompt,
# or add/consult the flag.

# gluerun_ctx_assumptions_carry <prior-ledger-json> <seed-ledger-json>
#
# A PURE ledger->ledger transform. Reads BOTH JSON arguments (no file I/O, no events,
# reads no flag) and prints the merged ledger JSON on stdout:
#   {"schema":"gluerun.orchestration.ctx-assumptions.v0",
#    "assumptions":[{"id":"A1","status":..,"claim":..,"basis":..}, ...]}
#
#   - STRUCTURAL AUTHORITY = the seed: the output has EXACTLY the seed's assumption ids in
#     id order, each carrying the seed's `claim` and `basis`. Ids present only in the prior
#     ledger are NOT resurrected; ids new in the seed keep their seed `status`.
#   - STICKY VIOLATION: for a seed entry whose id appears in the prior ledger with `status`
#     `violated`, the output status is `violated`; otherwise it is the seed's status. A
#     host-observed violation thus carries forward like an open finding until addressed.
#   - FIRST ATTEMPT / EMPTY PRIOR: an empty, absent, or `{}` prior ledger yields the seed
#     ledger unchanged (carry is identity on the seed).
#   - Deterministic + read-only: identical inputs yield byte-identical output; re-carrying
#     an already-carried ledger against the same prior is a fixed point; neither input JSON
#     nor any file is mutated.
