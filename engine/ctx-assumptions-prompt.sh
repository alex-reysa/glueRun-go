# Pure prompt-render brick of the per-run assumption ledger (stage S4-context-packets,
# node assumption-ledger). Sourced exactly once by the context-evolution loader block in
# lib.sh (it matches the ctx-*.sh glob). Like engine/ctx-assumptions.sh and
# engine/ctx-assumptions-transition.sh, this file defines PURE helpers and is
# present-but-uncalled by every existing engine/CLI/driver path, so with it sourced the
# engine stays byte-identical to prior behavior (notably under SINGULAR_CTX_PACKET=0,
# which no path here consults; the flag gate lives at the later wire-in site).
#
# The seed emits a ledger whose assumptions carry stable ids A1..An; the host-derived
# transition flips violated entries' status to `violated`. This slice turns that ledger
# into prompt text for the two consumers that close the loop:
#   - the implementer/fix prompt, which must ADDRESS violated assumptions like open
#     findings while keeping the rest true for context, and
#   - the auditor prompt, which must VERIFY the assumptions were not silently violated
#     and raise a finding CITING the assumption's id for any violation — the assumptionId
#     the host-derived transition then resolves to flip that entry to `violated`.
#
# Both helpers are pure string->string transforms over the ledger argument: they read no
# files, consult no flag, and emit no events. A ledger with zero assumptions (or an
# absent/empty/malformed ledger argument) renders the empty string, so a later wire-in
# injects nothing and prompts stay unchanged. This slice does NOT touch driver files,
# inject into any real prompt, add per-attempt carry or capsule recording, or add/consult
# the flag — those are later slices for this node.

# singular_ctx_assumptions_fix_section <ledger-json>
#
# Renders the implementer/fix-prompt section on stdout. Violated assumptions are
# foregrounded as open findings to address (each with its id and claim); the remaining
# non-violated assumptions follow for context. Both lists are in id order (A1, A2, ...).
# A ledger with zero assumptions (or an absent/empty/malformed argument) renders "".
