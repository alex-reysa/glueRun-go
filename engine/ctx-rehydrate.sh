# ctx-rehydrate.sh — pure, read-only rehydration packet assembler (stage
# S5-routing, node `rehydrate-path`, layer engine_runtime). Sourced exactly once
# by the context-evolution loader block in lib.sh (it matches the ctx-*.sh glob).
# This file DEFINES new helpers and is present-but-uncalled by every existing
# engine/CLI/driver path, so with it sourced the engine stays byte-identical to
# prior behavior. The `rehydrate` strategy is already a reserved alphabet slot in
# the integrated engine/ctx-route.sh; the routing wire-in (routing `rehydrate`
# on a refused resume behind SINGULAR_REHYDRATE=1, recording the manifest into the
# strategy event) and the l1-drive.sh injection hook are SEPARATE later slices and
# are OUT OF SCOPE here. SINGULAR_REHYDRATE gates that future wire-in, not this
# pure assembler.

#   singular_ctx_rehydrate_packet   <id>=<path> [<id>=<path> ...]
#   singular_ctx_rehydrate_manifest <id>=<path> [<id>=<path> ...]
#
# Both assemble a deterministic, section-capped, quarantine-aware view over a
# fixed set of durable artifact sources, each tagged with a source-class id
# (task-packet, implementer-capsule, reviewer-capsule, findings-ledger,
# assumptions-ledger, critique-record, decision-record):
#
#   - `..._packet`  prints the rehydration packet on stdout: one labeled section
#     per surviving source, `=== <id> ===` header then the artifact's text body,
#     each body truncated to at most SINGULAR_CONTEXT_SECTION_MAX_CHARS (default
#     4000, honoring the engine/lib.sh knob) with a stable truncation marker.
#   - `..._manifest` prints a deterministic JSON manifest on stdout: the INCLUDED
#     source ids together with the sha256 of each artifact's bytes ("which
#     artifacts, which hashes") for a later routing slice to embed in a strategy
#     event.
#
# Deterministic: identical artifact bytes yield byte-identical packet and
# byte-identical manifest across runs; sources are emitted in a fixed, documented
# order (the source-class order above), independent of argument or on-disk
# enumeration order.
#
# Quarantine-aware: each candidate is filtered through the integrated
# singular_ctx_artifact_exclude, so a `*.quarantined` source, or any source with a
# `.quarantined` sibling on disk, never reaches the packet or the manifest.
#
# Pure and READ-ONLY: it reads artifact paths and hashes their contents but never
# writes, renames, or deletes anything, and never exits non-zero on well-formed
# input. It confers NO independence: it neither marks a session as satisfying an
# independence-required step nor records any source as `authoritative` evidence
# (rehydrated sessions remain tainted, pinned in engine/ctx-route.sh).
