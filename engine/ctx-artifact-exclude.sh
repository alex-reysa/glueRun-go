# ctx-artifact-exclude.sh — quarantine-aware exclusion filter for durable context
# artifacts (stage artifact-secret-scan, layer engine_runtime). Sourced exactly
# once by the context-evolution loader block in lib.sh (it matches the ctx-*.sh
# glob). This file defines a PURE, read-only, present-but-uncalled helper: no
# existing engine/CLI/driver path invokes it, so with it sourced the engine
# stays byte-identical to prior behavior. The assembly wire-in that applies this
# filter is a separate later slice and is OUT OF SCOPE here.

# gluerun_ctx_artifact_exclude [path...]
#   (candidate paths may also be supplied one-per-line on stdin)
#
# Given a set of candidate artifact paths, drops every quarantined entry:
#   * any path ending in the fixed `.quarantined` suffix, and
#   * any original path whose `.quarantined` sibling exists on disk,
# and emits only the surviving safe paths on stdout, order-stable. This ensures
# a quarantined artifact can never reach a rendered prompt or rehydration packet.
# It is PURE and READ-ONLY: it inspects paths (and tests for `.quarantined`
# siblings) but never writes, renames, or deletes anything.
