# ctx-plan-recritic-resume.sh — the plan-revision-loop RE-CRITIQUE resume
# authority brick. Stage-file deliverable of the executable DAG node
# `plan-revision-loop` (stage S3-plan-revision, area plancritic, layer
# engine_runtime, kind runtime):
#
#   "Revised candidates re-enter the critic (same critic session where its gates
#    allow — its prior concerns are the checklist)."
#
# The integrated revise loop engine/ctx-plan-revise-loop.sh (TASK-0023)
# re-critiques every round by running the plan-critic FRESH
# (engine/ctx-plan-critic.sh always runs fresh — no --resume/session reuse), so
# the same-critic-session carry-over on re-critique does not yet exist. This file
# adds the fail-closed authority that decides whether a re-critique may RESUME the
# persisted per-node critic session (where its gates allow) or must run FRESH,
# plus the recorder that makes the carry-over observable to ctx-metrics.sh.
#
# It is the plan-critic (skeptic-role) variant of the integrated planner-resume
# decider singular_planner_resume_decide (TASK-0009): the same single-line
# `resume <sessionId>` / `fresh <reason>` contract, the same ordered fail-closed
# gates (the FIRST failing gate names the reason), reusing the
# singular.orchestration.session-meta.v0 shape the plan-critic driver already
# FINALIZES at <state-dir>/sessions/plan-critic/<node>.json (role plan-critic,
# TASK-0013, explicitly earmarked usable by Stage 3 carry-over). The gate deltas
# from the planner decider are the enable knob (SINGULAR_PLAN_RECRITIC_RESUME),
# the role gate (plan-critic instead of planner), the critic prompt TEMPLATE
# (the plan-critic base prompt), and the critic session-lease path. Because a plan-critic
# session is resumable ONLY through the plan-critic role gate and a planner
# session ONLY through the planner role gate, a re-critique may re-enter a skeptic
# session and NEVER a planner/implementer one, and vice versa.
#
# Distinct from the separate post-acceptance `critic-carryover` node
# (SINGULAR_CRITIC_RECHECK_PCT), which rechecks an ACCEPTED diff; this brick is the
# in-loop re-critique of REVISED candidates.
#
# Auto-sourced by the ctx-loader block in lib.sh (engine/ctx-*.sh). Defines NEW
# functions only; NO existing engine path invokes them, so with this file
# present-but-uncalled the engine is byte-identical to prior behavior (mirroring
# engine/ctx-plan-revise-resume.sh): no events, no state writes. It never owns
# engine/lib.sh, adds NO driver-file hook, and invokes NO runner.
#
# Evidence invariance / advocate-skeptic line: these functions decide and record
# only. Every gate fails closed — any ambiguity (missing/unparseable meta,
# unreadable template, indeterminate ancestry, empty/absent fields, a lease whose
# holder cannot be proven dead) resolves to `fresh <reason>`, NEVER to `resume`.
# Routing never weakens a gate to make a fresh-required decision resumable, never
# makes the fresh implementation auditor bypassable, and never lets a resumed
# (tainted) critic session satisfy an independence-required step. Events land only
# in the pinned SINGULAR_EVENTS_FILE.
#
# The single SINGULAR_PLAN_RECRITIC_RESUME-gated consult hook inside the
# re-critique step of engine/ctx-plan-revise-loop.sh (behind the new knob) and the
# test-ctx-plan-revision.sh resume-re-critique full-walk are the sanctioned
# follow-up slice of this node and are OUT OF SCOPE here.
#
# Gate order (first failure wins):
#   1. disabled              SINGULAR_PLAN_RECRITIC_RESUME unset/!=1 (default 0 = OFF)
#   2. no-session            meta missing / unparseable
#   3. no-session-id         empty provider or sessionId
#   4. role-mismatch         role is not exactly "plan-critic"      (skeptic gate)
#   5. node-mismatch         meta.node != target node
#   6. head-rewritten        meta.headShaAtCreate NOT an ancestor of target head
#   7. runner-changed        runner basename differs
#   8. prompt-template-changed  meta.promptSha256 != sha256(critic base-prompt TEMPLATE)
#   9. expired               age > SINGULAR_SESSION_MAX_AGE_SEC / missing createdAt
#  10. worktree-moved        meta.cwd != worktree
#  11. leased                a LIVE critic session-lease held
#   -> resume <sessionId>    when every gate passes
