# ctx-artifact-quarantine.sh — quarantine-on-hit containment for durable context
# artifacts (stage artifact-secret-scan, layer engine_runtime). Sourced exactly
# once by the context-evolution loader block in lib.sh (it matches the ctx-*.sh
# glob). This file defines a PURE, present-but-uncalled helper: no existing
# engine/CLI/driver path invokes it, so with it sourced the engine stays
# byte-identical to prior behavior. The finalize-site hook that fires quarantine
# is a separate later slice and is OUT OF SCOPE here.
#
# gluerun_ctx_artifact_quarantine <run_dir>
#
# Enumerates the durable context artifacts by REUSING the integrated enumerator
# (gluerun_ctx_artifact_scan_paths) and the shared secret patterns
# (gluerun_secret_scan_patterns). For every artifact whose content matches a
# secret pattern it:
#   1. renames the artifact to `<path>.quarantined` — the content is PRESERVED
#      under the new name (never deleted), so forensic evidence is retained;
#   2. appends exactly one `ctx.artifact_secret` event recording the artifact
#      path and the matched pattern label; and
#   3. leaves the task outcome alone.
# It is NON-BLOCKING: it returns success (exit 0) even when it quarantines hits,
# unlike detection-mode scan which fails closed. Clean artifacts are left
# byte-for-byte untouched (not renamed, no event). Already-quarantined paths
# (suffix `.quarantined`) are skipped. Exit 2 only on genuine misuse (the
# artifacts path is not a directory, or a required helper is unavailable).
